# Automated-Ultimate-Production

## To do: just starting the project
0. Get a test video where there are few shot changes, use several sources (different championships, why not those where the quality of the production is less amazing because there will be fewer shot changes)
1. To check the quality of the algorithm, we need to know how to measure if the real life production image is moving right or left to follow the action
2. Predict the center of gravity of the action (predict balance because the movements at the bottom (near camera) of the image will be more intense than at the top. Use methods such as saliency maps or other motion detection
3. Predict camera movements, use 1. to measure their relevance against real life production.
